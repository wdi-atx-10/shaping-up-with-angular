## Deliverables

Define the following terms as they relate to AngularJS. 1-3 sentences each will suffice... You can either modify this README directly or create a new text file. Submit this as you would any other homework.

* Module is -A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module. ... var app = angular. module("myApp", []); The "myApp" parameter refers to an HTML element in which the application will run. Now you can add controllers, directives, filters, and more, to your AngularJS application

* Controller- In AngularJS, a Controller is defined by a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the AngularJS Scope. When a Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive, AngularJS will instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's constructor function.

* Data Binding- Data Binding. Data-binding in AngularJS apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components. The way that AngularJS implements data-binding lets you treat the model as the single-source-of-truth in your application. The view is a projection of the model at all times.

* Directive-AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng- . The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application. ... The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

* Angular Expression (i.e., `{{ }}`)-AngularJS expressions are JavaScript-like code snippets that are mainly placed in interpolation bindings such as <span title="{{ attrBinding }}">{{ textBinding }}</span> , but also used directly in directive attributes such as ng-click="functionExpression()"

* Model-The ngModel directive binds an input , select , textarea (or custom form control) to a property on the scope using NgModelController, which is created and exposed by this directive. ngModel is responsible for: Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as input , textarea or select require.
