* Module
  This is where the pieces of the AngularJS application are written.  Modules allow the code to be more maintainable, testable and readable.
  Dependencies for the application are defined in modules. Modules also define other modules.

* Controller
  Controllers helps us get data onto the page. This is where we define our apps behavior by defining functions and values.

* Data Binding
  Expressions are reevaluated when a property changes.

* Directive
  A directive is a marker in an html tag that tells AngularJS to run or reference some javascript code. This is how we bind the behaviors in our application.

* Angular Expression (i.e., `{{ }}`)
  Expressions are used to insert dynamic values into our html.  They can be numeric or strings.

* Model
  The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
