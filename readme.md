Submit this as you would any other homework.* Module  //The module is the outer component or container which houses the views, controllers and other parts of an angular app.* Controller  //Angular follows the MVC (model, view, controller) model for writing code. A best practice is to have fat models, dumb views, and skinny controllers. The controllers are the logic portion and are javascript functions that have a specific scope.* Data Binding  //in Angular, this refers to having the model and view components automatically synchronize their data* Directive  A directive is an html attribute (such as app or model ) that has been extended and uses the prefix ng (ng-app). They serve as DOM element markers that let you create custom tags and in turn manipulate them.* Angular Expression (i.e., `{{ }}`)* Model  // a model is the "factory" of the Angular app or the "schema" of the data. The ng-model is used to bind HTML values to the data of the app.## Additional Resources* [AngularJS Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angularjs/angularjs_overview.htm)## Bonus* Watch the remaining "Shaping Up With Angular" lessons
