1) Module - Modules are called when, angular specific code needs to be introduced withing an app. It appears to be used in a similar manner as require in node.js or import in react.

2) Controller - Is the place where an app's behavior is defined. Similar to a component in react, functions and variables can be here as a way of creating an element idependently of the main html.

3) Data Binding - This is similar to setting the state or properties in React. Essentially data binding, in most languages, is a way of dynamically displaying data on a page that isn't hardcoded onto it. Therefore, in future application, displaying data this way is much more scalable since bound data values can be reused to show different inputs.

4) Directive - This seems to be a parameter in angular that can be set to run certain functions. The example in the video was a hide-show function, based upon the amount avaliable of a particular variable. Seems to be a clean way of running very basic styling and logic edits in real time.

5) Angular Expression (i.e., `{{ }}`) - This is how we communicate with the native languages to display the values (states, properties, data) that we create in angular controllers.

6) Model - Provides a basis for certain elements on a page, defines what the purpose of the element is and what kind of input it can take or send.
